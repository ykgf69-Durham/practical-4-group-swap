    <h1><u>Code Breaking</u></h1>
    <p>Throughout the history of war, many have realised that one of the most powerful things a nation can wield is intelligence. Blindly charging into battle with no plan or tactics and no idea of what you are up against is a fool's errand - one that practically guarantees defeat.</p>
    <p>There is one major flaw with this - when your men are spread out across vast distances, with the enemy lying in wait between you, how can you send a message without giving everything away in the case of capture?</p>
    <p>This is what lead to the invention of ciphers - algorithms which can hide the meaning of a message, but in a way where a reverse algorithm can reveal the original information</p>

    <h1><u>Early ciphers</u></h1>
    <p>One of the simplest ciphers is the Caeser cipher. This cipher works by simply shifting every letter in the alphabet by a number, and writing the message using this. A cipher like this is useful as it makes the plaintext completely illegible to any reader, yet does not require much effort to encrypt or decrypt</p>
    <p>This is also its distinct disadvantage - its simplicity makes it laughably easy to decrypt even when the key - the number by which the alphabet is shifted - is not known. This completely defeats the purpose of the cipher, making it useless.</p>
    <p>If we truly want to obscure information from those we do not want to read it, we have to do more than this.</p>

    <h1><u>Enigma</u></h1>
    <p>For WW2, the Germans developed a type writer-like machine called Enigma. Whenever a key was pressed in Enigma, a series of rotors would decide which lamp it lights up. These rotos would then spin, constantly shifting the cipher. Each day, new settings would be input, meaning that the encryption function differently and, as there were so many possible settings, it would be near impossible to brute force. But decrypting was still simple for the Germans, as you could enter the same daily settings into your own Enigma machine and then type in the ciphertext to then be given the original plaintext back.</p>
    <p>Due to the complexity of enigma, the Germans believed it unbreakable.</p>

    <br>
    <p>During the war, Alan Turing and co. developed the Bombe machine at Bletchley park. This machine is often considered among the first computers ever made, and it was made for one purpose - to break Enigma by figuring out the daily settings</p>
    <p>Due to Bletchley's success, the allies were able to read many of the German communications, winning the war of intelligence. The allied generals now would know all about the German's military plans and movements</p>
    <p>It is estimated that breaking Enigma cut 2 years off of the war - saving countless people lives and ending the Nazi's tyranny</p>
