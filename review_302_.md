Maintainability
  Ideally, organise more by seperating imgs and/or webpages seperately in a folder or group imgs with their respective webpages
  Also naming pages their titles rather than page1, page2 etc to improve maintainability and organisation
  

Style
  Good clear sectioning with the boxes/divs
  Try to have nav bar consistent e.g not removing the tab of the page you're on - stops nav-bar changing size or moving tabs
  lots of empty space to the right of the page as none of your sizing is relative but fixed
