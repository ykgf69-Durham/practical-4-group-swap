    <h1><u>Communication</u></h1>
    
    <p>Computer Science has impacted communication for many years. 
        From emails to messaging to face time to social media, this has continued to develop.</p>
    <p>This has allowed for people to communicate quickly and from everywhere around the world.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, it has promoted working from home which can allow people more freedom 
        in their work day, can save money on commuting and can help alleviate stress.
